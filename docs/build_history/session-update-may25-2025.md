# Session Update - May 25, 2025

## Overview
Successfully reorganized project structure and created a Python audio preview system for continuous playback review. This session focused on file organization improvements and building preview functionality to streamline the audio review workflow.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Project Structure Reorganization
**Problem:** Mixed file types in single folder (`script-files/` contained only JS files but was getting Python files)
**Solution:** Created language-specific organization

**New Structure:**
```
tts-project/
├── scripts/
│   ├── js/              # JavaScript TTS generation tools
│   │   ├── generate-audio.js
│   │   ├── edit-single-line.js
│   │   ├── test-api.js
│   │   ├── test-connection.js
│   │   ├── test-voices.js
│   │   └── list-voices.js
│   └── python/          # Python audio tools
│       └── preview-audio.py
├── script-files/        # Original folder (can be removed after testing)
├── output/              # Generated MP3 files
├── requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
├── script.txt           # Current podcast script
├── .env                 # API keys
└── [other existing folders]
```

### 2. File Path Updates
**Challenge:** Moving files to subdirectories broke relative path references
**Solution:** Updated all path references in moved files

**JS Files (in `scripts/js/`):**
- `output/` → `../../output/`
- `script.txt` → `../../script.txt`
- `timing-log.txt` → `../../timing-log.txt`

**Python File (in `scripts/python/`):**
- Looks for `output/` when run from project root

### 3. Python Audio Preview System
**Goal:** Create continuous playback preview to hear full sequence before Audacity assembly
**Result:** Feature-rich preview tool with real-time controls

**Key Features:**
- **Continuous playback** with 1.5-second natural gaps between files
- **Real-time controls** without stopping audio:
  - SPACEBAR = Pause/Resume
  - B = Back to previous file
  - N = Skip to next file
  - R = Repeat current file
  - S = Stop preview
  - ? = Show help
- **Live file display** showing current file as it plays
- **Threading** for responsive keyboard input during playback
- **Natural workflow** integration with existing edit-single-line capability

### 4. Python Environment Setup
**Added:** `requirements.txt` for dependency management
```
# Python dependencies for TTS Project
pygame>=2.1.0
```

**Installation:** `pip install pygame` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Technical Implementation Details

### Preview System Architecture
- **Class-based design** (`AudioPreview` class) for better state management
- **Threaded keyboard listener** using Windows-specific `msvcrt` for non-blocking input
- **File sorting** by numerical prefix (001, 002, etc.)
- **Error handling** for audio file loading issues
- **Configurable gap duration** (currently 1.5 seconds)

### Path Resolution Strategy
**Decision:** Run scripts from project root using relative paths
- JS: `node scripts/js/generate-audio.js`
- Python: `python scripts/python/preview-audio.py`
- Maintains existing workflow while improving organization

### Language Choice Rationale
**JavaScript for TTS:** API integration, async operations, existing working system
**Python for Audio:** Better audio libraries, interactive controls, cross-platform audio support

## Workflow Integration

### Current Complete Workflow
1. **Generate:** `node scripts/js/generate-audio.js`
2. **Preview:** `python scripts/python/preview-audio.py`
3. **Edit if needed:** Modify `scripts/js/edit-single-line.js` and run
4. **Re-preview:** Run preview again, using 'R' to restart from edited line
5. **Final assembly:** Import to Audacity with sound effects

### Preview Benefits
- **Catch issues early** before time-consuming Audacity work
- **Natural pacing** preview with realistic gaps
- **Quick iteration** when combined with single-line editing
- **Full sequence review** rather than individual file checking

## Files Created/Modified This Session

### New Files
- `scripts/js/generate-audio.js` (updated paths)
- `scripts/js/edit-single-line.js` (updated paths)
- `scripts/python/preview-audio.py` (new continuous preview system)
- `requirements.txt` (Python dependencies)

### Path Updates Made
- Changed all `output/` references to `../../output/` in JS files
- Changed `script.txt` to `../../script.txt` in generate-audio.js
- Changed `timing-log.txt` to `../../timing-log.txt` in generate-audio.js

## Testing Status
✅ **Structure reorganization** - Files moved and paths updated
✅ **Python preview system** - Working continuous playback with controls
✅ **JS generation system** - Still functional with new paths
✅ **Dependencies** - pygame installed and requirements.txt created

## Outstanding Items/Future Enhancements

### Immediate
- Test edit-single-line.js with new structure
- Remove old `script-files/` folder after confirming everything works
- Copy remaining JS files (test-api.js, etc.) to new location

### Potential Future Features
- **Cross-platform keyboard handling** (currently Windows-specific)
- **Adjustable gap duration** via command line argument
- **Script text display** showing actual dialogue during playback
- **Jump to line number** functionality
- **Mark files for editing** during preview
- **Batch editing mode** for multiple line changes

## Development Philosophy Maintained
- **Incremental approach** - Built preview system step by step
- **Test early and often** - Verified each component before proceeding
- **Preserve working systems** - Kept original files until new structure tested
- **User-driven functionality** - Features match actual workflow needs

## Key Learnings
1. **File organization matters** - Mixed language files in single folder creates confusion
2. **Path dependencies require careful planning** during reorganization
3. **Threading essential** for responsive audio control interfaces
4. **Continuous preview reveals timing issues** better than individual file review
5. **Requirements files valuable** even for simple projects

## Next Session Quick Start
1. **Verify setup:** Check that both JS and Python scripts work from new locations
2. **Clean up:** Remove old `script-files/` folder if everything works
3. **Ready to use:** Full preview → edit → preview workflow is operational

## Session Context Notes
- **User prefers:** Step-by-step approach, testing at each stage
- **Platform:** Windows 11, VS Code, Node.js + Python hybrid approach
- **Goal:** Streamlined audio generation and review workflow
- **Working system:** ElevenLabs TTS → numbered MP3s → Audacity assembly
