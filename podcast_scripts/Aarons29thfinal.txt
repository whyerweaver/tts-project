AARON: To some degree, for sure, but I also brought a substantial amount of experience and interests to the table too. Before UConn, I'd spent time as an intern and worked in Germany, (nothing broadens one's perspective like another culture). I've always enjoyed Science Fiction and loved History. Each, in their own way, helped prepare me for the evolving nature of my career.  Everything should be considered relevant to some extent. As an example, one of my earliest hobbies, gaming, still colors my approach to Law.
LAURA: An interesting idea. I can see how History, the roots of Law, and Science fiction, with it's openness to technology, blended to prepare you for the state of flux in the legal profession, but gaming?
AARON: Well Laura, A competent gamer is always thinking logically, analyzing complex environments and planning their next move, all things any good attorney should also be striving to do.
LAURA: So you think that a background in History and gaming fostered your ability to appreciate the present state of the profession while adapting to the new realities, that's a fascinating connection.– From your perspective, how have you reconciled the traditional 'by the books' nature of Law with these emerging technologies?
AARON: To be honest, at times, it felt like navigating elaborate, interconnected chambers. But just as in gaming, if you combine understanding with perseverance the right connections will eventually emerge. The rewards more than justify the effort. 
CHRIS: Gaming, now it makes sense, not more than 'casual' myself, but the grinders probably picked up on, "Interconnected chambers" and "optimal path"— I hear you.. Sounds like you've been "thinking with portals" long before you ever stepped into a courtroom. It's interesting how those kinds of games can sharpen your mind.
AARON: Absolutely. They teach you to analyze systems, anticipate outcomes, and make strategic decisions under pressure – all skills that translate directly to the legal profession.
LAURA: We appreciate your sharing you're unique journey with us. You've brought into focus an aspect of your generations life experiences we might have easily overlooked.   To wrap this up, looking ahead, how do you see Parrett, Porto, Parese & Colwell positioning themselves to continue adapting and thriving in this evolving legal landscape?
AARON: We take pride in both tradition and adaptability. Always seeking to integrate and utilize new technologies for deeper insights – using AI tools to analyze data, predict outcomes, and even draft documents. These algorithms and data streams are catapulting our firm to the next level. Fostering the synergy of technology and community, we recently welcomed attorneys Robert Saraco and Paige Buonocore to our team . They bring fresh perspectives, new talents and timely skills. But our challenge remains: applying human judgment where tech falls short. It's about enhancing foresight, not replacing it.
CHRIS: Foresight, Aaron, that's the recurring theme. You represent a new breed: not just reacting to change, but understanding its mechanics. You demonstrate how classic skills harnessed to the new technology are powering the way forward. Whether unraveling a legal puzzle, anticipating the next tactical maneuver, or, as GLaDOS might say, discerning when the promise of something great... is ultimately 'a lie.' Your clarity, forged through study and strategy, illuminates paths where others see shadows. You're a testament to how young professionals are shaping the future.
LAURA: Thank you for calling in.
AARON: My pleasure. Thanks for having me.
CHRIS: Thanks for listening. Stay curious, stay adaptable.
