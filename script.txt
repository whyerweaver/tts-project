LAURA: Welcome to the show.
AARON: Hi Laura, Chris. I'm Aaron, from Connecticut.
LAURA: Welcome, Aaron from Connecticut! What's on your mind today regarding the evolving workplace?
AARON: I've been thinking thinking a lot about impact of AI and the need for adaptability.  It really resonates with me, especially in law. 
CHRIS: Hi Aaron, this is Chris. Law, not the first profession that comes to mind when you think of AI and it's impact. 
AARON: True, but I'm an associate attorney at Parrett, Porto, Parese & Colwell in Southington. We're finding that technology and data are rapidly influencing strategy, pushing us to constantly evolve our problem-solving. 
CHRIS: Aaron, give us a bit of insight on how the diverse subjects Law, and Technology, came into focus in your own life. Some background to appreciate the path a young professional took enabling them to play a role in the dramatic changes we're all facing?
AARON: My academic journey started at Holy Cross, building a strong foundation. At UConn Law in Hartford, I learned that precision was crucial, an essential preparation for my passing the bar in July 2023 and being sworn in that November. My very first steps included an internship at the U.S. Attorney's Office. I discovered there that  applying Law was about dissecting intricate problems, and identifying optimal paths. 
CHRIS: So the time with the U.S. Attorney, navigating civil and criminal waters, helped to further hone your strategic thinking?
AARON: Definitely, they taught me to understand the legal landscape, anticipate moves, and develop strategy. Like a complex battlefield, decisions ripple. I learned to identify patterns and secure objectives.
LAURA: Then your first encounter real world with Law was where you began to appreciate the growing impact of technology on the profession? 
AARON: To some extent, for sure, but I also brought a substantial amount of experience and interests to the table too. Before UConn, I'd spent time as an intern and worked in Germany, nothing broadens one's perspective like another culture. I've always enjoyed Science Fiction loved History. Each in their own way helped prepare me for the evolving nature of my career. As an example I think that one of my earliest hobbies, gaming, to some extent, still colors my approach to Law. 
LAURA: An interesting idea. I can see how History, the roots of Law, and Science fiction, with it's openness to technology, blended to prepare you for the legal profession's state of flux, but gaming?
AARON: Well Laura, A competent gamer is always thinking logically, analyzing complex environments and planning their next move, all things any good attorney should also be striving to do.
LAURA: So you think that a background in History and gaming fostered your ability to appreciate the present state of the profession while adapting to new the realities, that's a fascinating connection.– From your perspective, how have you reconciled the traditional 'by the books' nature of Law with these emerging technologies?
AARON: To be honest, at times, it felt like navigating elaborate, interconnected chambers. But just as in gaming, if you combine understanding with perseverance the right connections will eventually emerge. The rewards more than justify the effort. 
CHRIS: Gaming, now it makes sense, not more than 'casual' myself, but the grinders probably picked up on, "Interconnected chambers" and "optimal path"— I hear you.. Sounds like you've been "thinking with portals" long before you ever stepped into a courtroom. It's interesting how those kinds of games can sharpen your mind.
AARON: Absolutely. They teach you to analyze systems, anticipate outcomes, and make strategic decisions under pressure – all skills that translate directly to the legal profession.
LAURA: To wrap this up looking ahead, how is Parrett Porto positioned to continue adapting and thriving in this evolving legal landscape?
AARON: We take pride in both tradition and adaptability. We're constantly looking to integrate new technologies for deeper insights – AI tools to analyze data, predict outcomes, and even draft documents. With the algorithms and data streams just bringing our team to the next level. Focused on growth, and new perspectives we recently welcomed attorneys Robert Saraco and Paige Buonocore. They bring fresh talent and timely skills. But our challenge remains: applying human judgment where tech falls short. It's about enhancing foresight, not replacing it.
CHRIS: Foresight, Aaron, that's the recurring theme. You represent a new breed: not just reacting to change, but understanding its mechanics. You demonstrate how classic skills harnessed to the new technology are powering the way forward. Whether unraveling a legal puzzle, anticipating the next tactical maneuver, or, as GLaDOS might say, discerning when the promise of something great... is ultimately 'a lie.' Your clarity, forged through study and strategy, illuminates paths where others see shadows. You're a testament to how young professionals are shaping the future.
LAURA: Thank you for calling in.
AARON: My pleasure. Thanks for having me.
CHRIS: Thanks for listening. Stay curious, stay adaptable.
